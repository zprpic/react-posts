    Overview



    Create a React application that shows a list of Posts and associated post Comments that are fetched via provided API.

    Push the code to github + describe the build/run process in a Readme file

    Write approximate time needed to finish the assignment



    Features

        Create 2 routes: '/posts' & 'post/{id}'.

        Posts route should show a list of posts and associated comments. Every post should have a user's name associated.

        Create a search input and filter posts by user data using an input field.

        Clicking a post will open it in a new page

        MUST! EVERY component one rendered must log in the console 'Hello from <insert component name>'. The part 'Hello from' must be sent to a component via props and defined only once within the scope of the application. So it looks something like console.log('${propsmessage} ${componentName}'). Feel free to name the variable names as you see fit.
